# Skateboard
In this assignment is was presented with the task of creating a lego. I was given instructiins and measuremnts in order to prperly scale out and create the legos and duck. I learned many things from this project. In cluding the fact the designing in onshape is not hard to make and can be simplified using shortcuts and cheat codes. There were many shortcuts that were revealed to me that i will be using in the furture for assitance.

# 2.1 Deck

I was able to get a feel for the skatebord. I was taought that adding fillets and little details really make a difference in the apperence of the skateboard. two shortcuts i already knew but were very usefull during the whole project were S for new sketch and N for normal.

# 2.2 Truck

I learned that making new parts is way easier when you take and use excisting measurments from other premade parts. It simplifies the job and leaves very little room for error. Making the chance of me needing to go back and fix things way low. Another shortuct i discovered and did not know before was L which toggles the line tool on and off. 

# 2.3 Wheel and Bearing

Once again shortcuts made the make of this wheel take no time at all. I was very impressed in my self and the tools provided by onshape. My conficence in my building skills grew and became stronger. And lastyly the most shocking and short timed tool was the revolve tool when making my wheel. I was able to avoid the issue and complications that can often cone with extruding.

# 2.4 "Put it all together!"

Lastly the "Put it all together!" i loved putting all of this together, using the copy and paste tool so i dod not have to individually put togetehr the wheels, and truck hanger, etc. With minimal instruction and common snese i was able to successfully and correctly put toghter my skateboard. I really learned some new stuff from the project and can hepofully find use for it in the furutre.
